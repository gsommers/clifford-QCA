# clifford-QCA


Julia code and data used in [Crystalline Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10808) by Grace M. Sommers, David A. Huse, and Michael J. Gullans, for expressing spacetime translation-invariant unitary Clifford circuits as Clifford quantum cellular automata (CQCA). Functionality includes converting a unit cell of Clifford gates into the Laurent polynomial matrix form, getting recurrence times and operator spreading, and plotting the image of initially local Paulis.
